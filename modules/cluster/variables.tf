    A map of configuration options for the nodes to constitute the cluster.
    Only one node should have the "initial" attribute set to true.
    Be careful which node you decide to start the cluster,
      it must host the database for others to be able to join properly.
    There are 5 types of node: 'all-in-one', 'control-plane', 'worker', 'database', 'api'.
      'all-in-one' nodes have all roles (control-plane, worker, etcd)
      'control-plane' nodes have the api (control-plane) and database (etcd) roles
      'worker' nodes have just the 'worker' role
      'database' nodes have only the database (etcd) role
      'api' nodes have only the api (control-plane) server role
    By default we will set taints to prevent non-component workloads
      from running on database, api, and control-plane nodes.
    Size correlates to the server size options from the server module:
      https://github.com/rancher/terraform-aws-server/blob/main/modules/server/types.tf
    We recommend using the size nodes that best fit your use case:
      https://ranchermanager.docs.rancher.com/getting-started/installation-and-upgrade/installation-requirements#rke2-kubernetes
    OS correlates to the server image options from the server module:
      https://github.com/rancher/terraform-aws-server/blob/main/modules/image/types.tf
    We recommend using the same os for all servers, we don't currently test for clusters with mixed OS types.
    Indirect access refers to how the cluster will be load balanced,
      some admins are ok with every server in the cluster responding to inbound requests since the built in proxy will redirect,
      but that isn't always the best choice since some nodes (like database nodes and secure workers)
      are better to restrict to internal access only.
      Setting this value to true will allow the network load balancer to direct traffic to the node.
      Setting this value to false will prevent the load balancer from directing traffic to the node.
